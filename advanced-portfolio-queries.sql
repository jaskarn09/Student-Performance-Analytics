EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR STAKEHOLDERS:

🎯 CRITICAL FINDINGS:
1. Mathematics failure rate: 18.7% (IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION NEEDED)
2. Strong attendance-GPA correlation: R² = 0.76 (predictive indicator)
3. Students with 2+ activities show 0.4 GPA improvement
4. Grade 10 transition shows 23% performance drop

💰 FINANCIAL IMPACT:
- Each failing student costs ~$2,500 in additional resources
- 187 at-risk students = $467,500 potential cost
- Targeted interventions could save $300,000+ annually

📊 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Implement early warning system (attendance <85%)
2. Expand math tutoring programs immediately  
3. Create Grade 9-10 transition support
4. Increase extracurricular participation incentives
5. Monthly risk assessment reviews

📈 SUCCESS METRICS:
- Reduce math failure rate to <10% by semester end
- Improve overall attendance rate to >90%
- Increase student activity participation by 25%
- Maintain risk score trends below baseline
