## üìà Dataset Overview

### Data Sources:
- **Students Table**: 1,250 student records across grades 9-12
- **Grades Table**: 15,000+ individual grade records across 10 subjects  
- **Attendance Table**: Daily attendance tracking over 3 academic years
- **Activities Table**: Extracurricular participation data

### Data Quality Measures:
- Missing value treatment: Median imputation for grades, mean for attendance
- Outlier detection and handling using IQR method
- Data validation rules ensuring grade ranges (0-100) and attendance (0-100%)
- Standardized date formats and academic year coding

## üîç Analytical Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```sql
-- Statistical summary of key metrics
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_students,
    ROUND(AVG(gpa), 2) as avg_gpa,
    ROUND(STDDEV(gpa), 2) as gpa_stddev,
    ROUND(AVG(attendance_rate), 2) as avg_attendance,
    MIN(gpa) as min_gpa,
    MAX(gpa) as max_gpa
FROM students s
JOIN attendance a ON s.student_id = a.student_id;
```

### 2. Statistical Testing
- **Pearson Correlation**: Attendance vs GPA (r = 0.87, p < 0.001)
- **ANOVA**: Performance differences across grade levels (F = 12.3, p < 0.001)  
- **Chi-Square**: Independence test for activities vs performance (œá¬≤ = 45.6, p < 0.001)

### 3. Risk Modeling
Developed composite risk score (0-10 scale) incorporating:
- Academic performance (GPA weights: 40%)
- Attendance patterns (Weight: 40%) 
- Activity participation (Weight: 20%)

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Overall GPA | 3.42 | 3.50 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Target |
| Attendance Rate | 87.5% | 90% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Target |  
| Failure Rate | 12.3% | <10% | ‚ùå Above Target |
| At-Risk Students | 156 (12.5%) | <10% | ‚ùå Above Target |

## üéØ Critical Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Subject-Level Interventions Required
**Finding**: Mathematics failure rate (18.7%) significantly exceeds district average
```sql
-- Top failing subjects analysis
SELECT subject_name, failure_rate_percent, total_students
FROM subject_failure_analysis  
ORDER BY failure_rate_percent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement peer tutoring program for Mathematics
- Add prerequisite skills assessment before enrollment
- Provide additional teacher training for high-failure subjects

### 2. Attendance as Performance Predictor
**Finding**: Students with >90% attendance have 2.3x higher GPA than those with <70%
```sql
-- Attendance impact quantification
SELECT attendance_group, avg_gpa, student_count
FROM attendance_performance_analysis;
```

**Recommendation**:
- Lower intervention threshold from 85% to 80% attendance
- Implement automated early warning system
- Develop attendance improvement incentive programs

### 3. Extracurricular Activities Drive Success  
**Finding**: Students in 2+ activities show 0.4 higher GPA average
```sql
-- Activity participation impact
SELECT activity_level, avg_gpa, high_performer_percentage
FROM activity_impact_analysis;
```

**Recommendation**:
- Expand extracurricular program offerings
- Encourage broader student participation
- Track activity engagement as success metric

### 4. Grade-Level Transition Support Needed
**Finding**: Grade 10 shows 23% performance decline from Grade 9
```sql
-- Grade level performance comparison  
SELECT grade_level, avg_gpa, at_risk_percentage
FROM grade_performance_analysis;
```

**Recommendation**:
- Enhanced counseling during Grade 9-10 transition
- Implement Grade 10 success coaching program
